## Description

PenTest is a tool to show a few bits of info on your target that might be useful for dealing damage:

* Spell and Weapon Penetration
* Off Balance and Immunity
* Minor Vulnerability


To display Penetration values the following abilities are tracked:

* Major/Minor Breach
* Crusher (you have to define yourself in the settings if the normal or infused value is used)
* Alkosh
* Major/Minor Fracture
* Night Mother's Gaze
* Sunderflame


Additionally, the penetration values of your character (that are influenced by CP, sharpened weapons or by sets like Twice Fanged Serpent) are read from the API as well.
