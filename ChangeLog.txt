PenTest is a tool to show a few bits of info on your target that might be useful for dealing damage:

[LIST]
[*] Spell and Weapon Penetration
[*] Off Balance and Immunity
[*] Minor Vulnerability
[*] Critical Damage Bonus
[/LIST]

To display Penetration values the following abilities are tracked:

[LIST]
[*] Major/Minor Breach
[*] Crusher (you have to define yourself in the settings if normal or infused value is used)
[*] Alkosh
[*] Resistance Reduction by Poison
[*] Crystal Weapon
[*] Crimson Oath
[*] Tremorscale
[/LIST]

versions:

25: 26.878  (09.10.2022) 23:28 
[*] Updated values for Backstabber, Crimson etc. that got changed a while ago. (Thx to Matherios for reminding me)
[*] Added Force of Nature as a fixed value (whenever the CP is equipped). The value can be changed in the settings. I plan to rework this in the future to actually change based on the number of applied status effects but this will require a lot of work.

24: 22.038 (22.11.2021) 22:32
[*] Fixed an issue where the panel was shown out of combat even when the option to show it only in combat was enabled. (Thx to Yaov for reporting this)

23: 21.188 (14.11.2021) 23:16
[*] Added tracking of the current Critical Damage Bonus.
[*] Note: For the Warden passive "Glacial Presence" the addon relies on either Minor Brittle or Minor Maim, as the ESO Api does not directly allow to query a targets chilled status. There might be (relatively rare) situations where a target is chilled but Minor Brittle is not active and Minor Maim is overwritten by a different source with a longer duration.
[*] Updated tracked sources of penetration (Tremorscale, Poisons, Crimson Oath, Alkosh).
[*] Fixed some issues when the panel was hidden when not in combat even though it shouldn't have been.
[*] API Bump to Flames of Ambition (101032)
